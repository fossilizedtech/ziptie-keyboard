# ziptie-keyboard
Everyone has their own preference when it comes to keyboards. This is my attempt to make my dream keyboard. There are a lot of ideas that will be implemented over time and I do not recommend using this as a foundation for any other project unless you don't value your time. I am not an electrical engineer, and I have no idea what I'm doing. I'm just throwing bits and pieces together, hoping that I don't end up burning my house to the ground in the process.
